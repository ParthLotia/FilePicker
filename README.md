# PhotoPicker

Here is the Demo for the PhotoPicker in All Android Versions

I have added other pickers as well(pdf,doc,video,pictures).

I have tested with multiple scenarios , here is the scenario list

1. Android 8 to 13 versions
2. Also Add the Single Photo and Multiple Photo Selection
3. Single Photo Selection Working on All Android Versions
4. Multiple Photo Selection will work from Android 11 to Android 13.
5. Multiple Photo Selection below Android 11 we have to use clipdata the old way.
6. Single Selection of PDf and Document as well. You can preview of PDF you have selected.
7. Single Selection of Music and Video File as well.
7. For all above points you don't require a single permission.
